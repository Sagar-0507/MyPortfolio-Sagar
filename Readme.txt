gallery uses a modular approach which enables us to add more items to it very easily and made it possible to make a responsive tab (a tab that changes it's design according to tab/page size). 

gallery_1 uses basic design format as used in the website but it is not that much easily extendable so it is not used

we can interchange the name of gallery.html and gallery1.html
to use this design.

Index.html's previous name is welcome.html but I renamed it as soon as i found out that index.html is the standard starting page name.
